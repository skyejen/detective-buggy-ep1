            <p>
                This morning, a troubling event was reported in our own station:
                <br>the secure chicken treat stash has been emptied. 
            </p>

            <p>
                No signs of forced entry. No witnesses. Just a trail of crumbs and confusion.
            </p>

            <p class="image-bottom-line">
                The suspect is one of us.
            </p>

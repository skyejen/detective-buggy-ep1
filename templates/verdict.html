    <p>🎉 Justice has been served! The real culprit was indeed <strong>{{ guilty }}</strong>.</p>
    <p><strong>{{ guilty }}</strong> had always nursed a bitter jealousy of DI Buggy’s flawless record. 
      <br>He thought that claiming a chicken allergy would provide the perfect cover, but he underestimated Buggy’s nose for the truth.</p>
    <p>
      To cover his tracks, DS Spoony pressured DC Banana into corrupting the CCTV footage. 
      <br>Young, nervous, and eager to please his seniors, DC Banana gave in — but when guilt started to show, 
      <br>DS Spoony tied him up and stashed him in a supply closet.
    </p>

    <p>
      Banana's safe now… though he might need a week off and a lot of cuddles.

    <p>You wrongly accused <strong>{{ accused }}</strong>. The real culprit walks free...</p>

      <p>DS Cookie may be fiery and stubborn, but she’s loyal to the bone.<br>Accusing her? That’s ruff, even for Buggy.</p>
    {% elif accused == "PC Steven" %}
      <p>PC Steven? The quiet gull who barely leaves the CCTV desk?<br>Perhaps Buggy let paranoia cloud his judgment this time.</p>
    {% elif accused == "PC Noodle" %}
      <p>PC Noodle — harmless, bumbling, obsessed with vending machines.<br>His only crime is poor snack choices, not chicken theft!</p>
    {% elif accused == "DC Banana" %}
      <p>DC Banana? The poor soul was hiding, terrified out of his peel. A victim, not a villain!</p>
    {% elif accused == "DS Theo" %}
      <p>DS Theo? Theo doesn't have such emotions, but Snakey is deeply offended on his behalf.</p>
    {% else %}
      <p>DI Buggy’s accusation missed the mark. The real culprit’s trail has gone cold...</p>

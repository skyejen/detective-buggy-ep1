# 🕵️ Detective Buggy: Episode 1 – A Bitter Bite

Detective Inspector Buggy returns to the station... only to find his precious chicken treats have gone missing. Who’s behind the snack sabotage?

This is a lighthearted mystery game built as part of my CS50x final project.

Built using **Python**, **Flask**, **Jinja2**, **Bootstrap**, and **SQLite** — with some (not) very serious paws-on QA 🐶

## 🚀 Features
- 🎤 Interactive suspect interviews
- 🧠 Clue-based deduction system
- 🗣️ Adaptive dialogue based on player progress
- 🗂️ Evidence board & branching logic

## 🛠️ Run Locally

Clone the repo and install dependencies:

```
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
flask run
```

Ensure python-dotenv is installed and a .env file exists for your secret keys (if applicable).

## 🌐 Hosting
This project is deployed using Render.
Deployment instructions or render.yaml will be added in a future update.

## 🛠️ Potential Improvements
A list of potential improvements for future versions:

- ✅ Replace some hardcoded logic with dynamic, database-driven content
- 📱 Improve layout and styling for mobile and small screens
- 🎨 Add simple animations for visual polish
- 🎵 Add audio support (ambience, barks, feedback sounds)
- 👣 Track player decisions for enhanced analytics *(note: analytics is currently private and optional)*
- 💾 [Stretch Goal] Implement user login/save progress system — not required for a small game, but a great learning opportunity!
